## TODO

1. Instead of having to pick a Tmux pane with Q by number, write some keyword in any pane, and the Q would get the current line from every pane, and use the identifier of the pane that has the keyword in it
2. Create a `T` minimode, similar to Git mode (gj), and when inside it, I can use C-u|C-d to scroll up and down
